## 🎓 Learning Approach

This project follows a **hands-on, incremental learning approach**:

1. **Concept First**: We explain the theory before implementation
2. **Real Examples**: Every concept is demonstrated with practical code
3. **Best Practices**: Industry standards are followed throughout
4. **Progressive Complexity**: We build from simple to complex features
5. **Production Ready**: Code is written with deployment in mind

## 📝 Development Guidelines

- All code must be written in TypeScript
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write tests for new features
- Use conventional commit messages
- Document complex logic
- Follow security best practices

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development servers
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn lint` - Check code quality
- `yarn format` - Format code with Prettier
